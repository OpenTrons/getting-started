    "# XY Belt Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "The OT1 uses elastic bands to travel along its X (left-right) and Y (forward-backward) axis. Very slight changes in length from stretching will cause the robot to slowly lose its ability to measure distances accurately. For example, we tell the robot to move 100mm, but it seems to move about 103mm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a solution! What we can do is simply tell the robot to move a certain distance, then measure and tell it how far it actually travelled. If done accurately, this will then fix it's internal calculations for determining \"real-world\" distances.\n",

    "<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>\n",
    "<p>Be very careful when changing the XY belt calibrations, as innacurate settings could make the robot move uncontrollably. If things go wrong and you wish to start fresh, you can always <a href=\"http://docs.opentrons.com/updating_firmware.html\">reload the firmware</a>.</p>\n",

    "<p>Distance accuracy is different from consistency. If your robot cannot move to the same location consistently, this is a different problem and more to do with the tension of your belts. Please contact Opentrons support to help troubleshoot solutions.</p>\n",
