    "The OT1 uses elastic bands to travel along its X (left-right) and Y (forward-backward) axis. Very slight changes in length from stretching will cause the robot to slowly lose its ability to measure distances accurately. For example, we tell the robot to move 100mm, but it seems to move about 103mm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a solution! What we can do is simply tell the robot to move a certain distance, then measure and tell it how far it actually travelled. If done accurately, this will then fix the robot's internal calculations for determining \"real-world\" distances.\n",
