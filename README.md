# Getting Started with Opentrons API

The following are some Jupyter Notebooks that aim to explain the API through interactive examples. You can start using Jupyter notebooks by:

1. [Installing the Anaconda-Navigator](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) **Python 3.5 version** (not 2.7)
2. Running the application Anaconda-Navigator once installed
3. Select the `Launch` button under "Jupyter Notebook"

> Please note that if you are viewing these on GitHub, the pages render differently than when running in Jupyter so some things look a little weird.
